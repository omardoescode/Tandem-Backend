# Tandem
To fight against procrastination by accountability, **Tandem** is a productivity platform where a user is matched with a user with similar interests, and working on similar tasks for a pre-determined amount of time. We encourage *mutual commitment* by having each user prove they have done work at the end of a session

By having to prove your work, a user is more likely to avoid procrastination to avoid embarrassment later.
